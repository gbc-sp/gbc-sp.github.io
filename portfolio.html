      <p>Information Management is crucial for me as a recent graduate looking for work. While talking to a prospective employer, she told me that she found a link to a number of YouTube videos that I had created when I was younger. This was not the professional image that I hoped to share. As a result, I have carefully searched and changed privacy settings on my social media to make sure that I have managed my personal image. I know that care and attention to privacy is important for me and for those around me and also will reflect on how I care about the company and colleagues where I work.</p>
